# Coding Challenge - Tic-Tac-Toe

Today we're going to test and improve our coding skills by creating a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. 

## Environment

Fork this repository, clone it on your machine and create a new environment inside the folder. Don't forget to activate it for the assignment. 
```bash
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Task

Write your own Tic-Tac-Toe game. The assignment file contains a description on how the game should work. It may also help you to create a good structure for your code. 

Before you start, have a look at the file [Intro_to_pseudocode.md](Intro_to_pseudocode.md). The technique described there could be useful for this task. 

## Minimal coding practices to keep in mind!

- Functions should have explicit names.
- Functions should have docstrings explaining how to call them
- Functions should be between 4-10 lines of code long

## Hints

In the ```tic_tac_toe.py``` file you will find the special if-statement ```if __name__ == '__main__':``` if you want to know more about it have a look into the [Example folder](Examples).
